### Data Setup

\  

A few manipulations are done of the input data.

```{r }
dsf <- readRDS('data/dsf_data_for_nimble.rds')   ## original data file

# Also load plotting functions samplesPlot and chainsPlot
source("R_functions/plotting_functions.R")

```

We specify covariates:

- $genotype_{dsf}=1$ when genotype = DSF, and 0 otherwise
- $genotype_{wt}=1$ when genotype = WT, and 0 otherwise 

```{r }
constants <- list(
    N = dsf$dsfData$N,
    distance = dsf$dsfData$distance,
    ## in original dataset: genotype 1=DSF, 2=WT
    genotype_dsf = ifelse(dsf$dsfData$genotype==1, 1, 0),   ## indicator for DSF
    genotype_wt  = ifelse(dsf$dsfData$genotype==2, 1, 0)    ## indicator for WT
    ## note: test plants are all WT genotype
)
```

The values of the $xf_{vector}$ data are truncated to be integers, for
compatibility with the Poisson distribution.

```{r }
data <- list(
    xf_source_plant = dsf$dsfData$xf_source_plant,
    xf_vector = floor(dsf$dsfData$xf_vector),   ## change to integers
    infected = dsf$dsfData$infected
)
```

We also create three additional vectors of indicies.  These contain the
indicies of the observed (non-NA) data, for each of $xf_{source\
plant}$, $xf_{vector}$, and $infected$.  These will be used in the
model to skip creating posterior predictive nodes, which speed
up the MCMC and overall mixing considerably.

```{r }
## indices of observed values for each set of data:
constants$obs_ind_plant <- which(!is.na(data$xf_source_plant))
constants$obs_ind_vector <- which(!is.na(data$xf_vector))
constants$obs_ind_infected <- which(!is.na(data$infected))

## and the counts of each:
constants$N_obs_plant <- length(constants$obs_ind_plant)
constants$N_obs_vector <- length(constants$obs_ind_vector)
constants$N_obs_infected <- length(constants$obs_ind_infected)
```


```{r include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
## Save original data, cleaned data, and constants as a list
nimbleDataList <- list(dsf=dsf, 
                       data=data, 
                       constants=constants)
save(nimbleDataList, file = 'output/nimble_data_list.RData')

load('output/nimble_data_list.RData')
```

### Convergence 

We assess convergence of two chains, each with 100,000 post burn-in samples.

\   

The Brooks-Gelman-Rubin diagnostic over two chains of indicates convergence.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(coda); library(dplyr); library(tidyr) 
```

```{r }
(grDiagnostic <- gelman.diag(samples))

# Make GR results usable as a data.frame, for manuscript table
grTable <- data.frame(pars = row.names(grDiagnostic$psrf),
                      gr = paste(round(grDiagnostic$psrf[,1], digits = 2), " (", round(grDiagnostic$psrf[,2], digits = 2), ")", sep = ""))
grTable
```

\  

Compare parameter estimates across the two chains, to visually
make sure they agree:

```{r }
chainsPlot(samples, nrows = 2, buffer.right = 1)
```

\   

The effective sample size of the first chain is satisfactory, with a
minimum of more than 1,000 effectively independent samples from all posterior
dimensions, resulting from the 100,000 post burn-in samples.

```{r} 
# Removed "eval = FALSE" from the chunk heading
(essTable <- round(cbind(
  length = apply(samples[[1]], 2, length),
  ESS    = effectiveSize(samples[[1]])
)))

essTable <- data.frame(pars = row.names(essTable),
                       ess = essTable[,2])
essTable

    `ciupper` = apply(samples[[1]], 2, function(x) quantile(x, 0.975))
), 5)

```

\   

### Interpretations (updated v5)

\   

##### Bacteria concentration in source plants (constant terms)

\   

$\beta_1$, the constant term in the log() predictor for 
source plant xf concentration in genotype DSF plants, is
essentially `r round(res["b[1]","mean"],3)`. Thus, the baseline xf
concentration (at distance=0) in genotype DFS plants is $e^{\beta_1}
\approx$ 44,000,000.

$\beta_2$, the constant term in the log() predictor for 
source plant xf concentration in genotype WT plants, is essentially `r round(res["b[2]","mean"],3)`,
slightly *higher* than the genotype DSF constant term.  Thus, the baseline xf
concentration (at distance=0) in genotype WT plants is $e^{\beta_2}
\approx$ 62,000,000.

These values of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ imply that
for the *same distance*, genotype WT plants will have more xf
bacteria than genotype DSF plants.  Specifically, higher in the WT
plants by
a factor of $e^{\beta_2-\beta_1} = e^{0.346}=$
`r round(exp(res["b[2]","mean"] - res["b[1]","mean"]), 3)`.

\   

##### Bacteria concentration in source plants (distance effect)

\   

$\beta_3$, the coefficient of distance in the log() predictor for 
source plant xf concentration in genotype DSF plants, is essentially
`r round(res["b[3]","mean"],3)`. For every additional unit of
distance, the source plant xf concentration in DSF plants will decrease by a factor
of $e^{\beta_3}=$ `r round(exp(res["b[3]","mean"]), 3)`.

$\beta_4$, the coefficient of distance in the log() predictor for 
vector xf concentration in genotype WT plants, is essentially
`r round(res["b[4]","mean"],3)`.  This is significantly lower than that
of genotype DSF plants, implying that the xf concentration decreases
 more rapidly (as a function of distance) in genotype WT plants, as
compared to genotype DSF plants.  Specicially, for every additional unit of
distance, the source plant xf concentration in WT plants will decrease by a factor
of $e^{\beta_4}=$ `r round(exp(res["b[4]","mean"]), 3)`.

\  


##### Bacteria presence or absense in source plant: true negative detections (new v5)

\   

We allow some probability that there is 0 bacteria present at the 
source plant test site, regardless of distance.  This probability is 
allowed to vary between DSF and WT source plant genotypes. 

For DSF source plants, the probability of bacteria being present is 
estimated as `r round(res["p_trans_plant_dsf","mean"],3)`, with 95% 
credible interval (`r round(res["p_trans_plant_dsf","cilower"],3)`,
`r round(res["p_trans_plant_dsf","ciupper"],3)`). 

For WT source plants, the probability of bacteria being present is 
estimated as `r round(res["p_trans_plant_wt","mean"],3)`, with 95% 
credible interval (`r round(res["p_trans_plant_wt","cilower"],3)`,
`r round(res["p_trans_plant_wt","ciupper"],3)`). 

This means that on average, there was a 47% chance of any bacteria
being present at the test site in DSF plants, and a 65% chance of any
bacteria being present at the test site in WT plants.

\   

##### Bacteria transmission from source plants to vectors (vector concentration effect)

\   

For DSF source plants, $\beta_5$ and $\beta_7$ determine the linear
relationship for how xf is transmitted to vectors, as
$\lambda_{vector} = \beta_5 + \beta_7 \cdot \lambda_{source\ plant}$.  We are
interested in the $\beta_7$ coefficient, which is approximately equal to 0.00037.  This means that for DSF source
plants, the vector xf concentration increases at a rate of 0.00037 times the source plant xf concentration.

For WT source plants, $\beta_6$ and $\beta_8$ determine the linear
relationship for how xf is transmitted to vectors, as
$\lambda_{vector} = \beta_6 + \beta_8 \cdot \lambda_{source\ plant}$.  We are
interested in the $\beta_8$ coefficient, which is approximately equal to 0.00024.  This means that for WT source
plants, the vector xf concentration increases at a rate of 0.00024 times the
source plant xf concentration.  This is a much *lower transmission
rate* from (source plants to vectors) for WT plants, as compared to DSF
plants.

\   

```{r}
#### Example of relationship between lambda_vector and lambda_source_plant
# Given a population in source plant, what would be the predicted pop in vectors?

# Coefficients for DSF
beta5 <- res[row.names(res) == "b[5]", "median"]
beta7 <- res[row.names(res) == "b[7]", "median"]
# Coefficients for WT
beta6 <- res[row.names(res) == "b[6]", "median"]
beta8 <- res[row.names(res) == "b[8]", "median"]

# Given a value near the median xf_source_plant value:
median_xf_source <- data$xf_source_plant[data$xf_source_plant > 0] %>% median(., na.rm = TRUE)
example_xf_source <- round(median_xf_source, -6)
# The predicted population size in vectors would be:
pred_xf_vector_dsf <- beta5 + beta7*example_xf_source
pred_xf_vector_wt <- beta6 + beta8*example_xf_source

pred_xf_vector_dsf
pred_xf_vector_wt
# Proportion of vector WT to vector DSF Xf pops
pred_xf_vector_wt/pred_xf_vector_dsf

```


##### Bacteria transmission from source plants to vectors: true negative detections (new v5)

\   

We allow some probability that  0 bacteria is transmitted to the
vector, regardless of the bacteria concentration in the source plant.
This probability is allowed to vary between DSF and WT source plant genotypes. 

For DSF source plants, the probability of bacteria being transmitted
to the vector is estimated as `r round(res["p_trans_vector_dsf","mean"],3)`, with 95%
credible interval (`r round(res["p_trans_vector_dsf","cilower"],3)`,
`r round(res["p_trans_vector_dsf","ciupper"],3)`).  
 
For WT source plants, the probability of bacteria being transmitted 
to the vector is estimated as `r round(res["p_trans_vector_wt","mean"],3)`, with 95%
credible interval (`r round(res["p_trans_vector_wt","cilower"],3)`,
`r round(res["p_trans_vector_wt","ciupper"],3)`).  

The probability of transmission of bacteria to the vectors was
extremely similar between DSF and WT plants.  Given there was bacteria
present at the source plant test site, then there is a 50% chance of
transmission to the vector from DSF source plants, and a 56% chance of
transmission from WT source plants.  These estimates were not
statistically significantly different.

\   

##### Probability of test plant infection (genotype effect) 

\   

$\beta_{9}$ gives the baseline probability of infection (on the logit
scale) for genotype DSF plants.  The 95% CI for $\beta_{9}$ is
(`r round(res["b[9]","cilower"], 2)`,
`r round(res["b[9]","ciupper"], 2)`).  Taking the inverse-logit
transformation $\left( \tfrac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \right)$, this gives a 95% CI for the baseline probability of infection for DSF
source plants as (`r round(1/(1+exp(-res["b[9]","cilower"])), 2)`,
`r round(1/(1+exp(-res["b[9]","ciupper"])), 2)`).  This
does not take xf concentration in the vector into account.

$\beta_{10}$ gives the baseline probability of infection (on the logit
scale) for genotype WT plants.  The 95% CI for $\beta_{10}$ is
(`r round(res["b[10]","cilower"], 2)`,
`r round(res["b[10]","ciupper"], 2)`).  Taking the inverse-logit
transformation $\left( \tfrac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \right)$, this gives a 95% CI for the baseline probability of infection for WT
source plants as (`r round(1/(1+exp(-res["b[10]","cilower"])), 2)`,
`r round(1/(1+exp(-res["b[10]","ciupper"])), 2)`).  This
does not take xf concentration in the vector into account.

\   

##### Probability of test plant infection (vector xf effect) (significant change v5)

\   

$\beta_{11}$ is the coefficient for vector xf level in the logit() predictor for test plant
infection.  That is, this (on the logit scale) determines how vector
xf concentration affects the probability of test plant infection.

This is noteworthy because in the previous Analysis 4, this term was
not signficantly different from 0.  But now, with the new
probabilistic models of zero transmissions, this term has a median
value of 0.00019, with 95% credible interval of (0.00006, 0.00037).

This means that increased vector xf concentration does have a
significant positive effect on the probability of test plant
infection.  It's difficult to exactly quantify how much the
probability of infection will increase as the vector xf concentration
increases, since this coefficient is on the logit scale.

However, given that the observed (non-zero) vector xf concentrations are
roughly between 1,000 and 60,000, this implies an increase (on the
logit scale) of between (1000)(0.00019) = 0.19 and (60000)(0.00019)
= 11.4.  An increase of 0.19 (on the logit scale) implies a
noteworthy, although not massive increase in the probability of
infection; the increase of 11.4 (on the logit scale) is large enough
to ensure a probability of infection essentially equal to 1.

\   

##### Bacteria detection (source plants, vectors) 

\   

$p_{obs.\ source\ plant}$, the probability of xf detection in source
plants, is bounded by the 95% CI (`r round(res["p_obs_plant","cilower"], 2)`,
`r round(res["p_obs_plant","ciupper"], 2)`), with median
`r round(res["p_obs_plant","median"], 3)`.  This means the test used has about
an 83% chance of detecting any xf bacteria in source plants.

\   

$p_{obs.\ vector}$, the probability of xf detection in vectors,
is bounded by the 95% CI (`r round(res["p_obs_vector","cilower"], 2)`,
`r round(res["p_obs_vector","ciupper"], 2)`) , with median
`r round(res["p_obs_vector","median"], 3)`.  This means the test used has about
a 37% chance of detecting any xf bacteria in vectors.

\   

##### Predictive distributions for test plant infection 

\   

The predictive nodes give the best idea of the probability of
infection, from either DSF or WT source plants, predicted at distance = 0.
These estimates take all model parameters and biological processes into account.

- Probability of infection for genotype DSF (at distance = 0) is in the 95% CI: (`r round(res["p_infect_dsf","cilower"], 2)`,
`r round(res["p_infect_dsf","ciupper"], 2)`), with median = `r round(res["p_infect_dsf","median"], 2)`. 
- Probability of infection for genotype WT (at distance = 0) is in the 95% CI: (`r round(res["p_infect_wt","cilower"], 2)`,
`r round(res["p_infect_wt","ciupper"], 2)`), with median = `r round(res["p_infect_wt","median"], 2)`. 

\   

Next, we look at the probabilities of infection from *all test plants*,
separated by genotype.  These do not assume any particular distance
(*e.g.*, distance = 0).  Instead, these quite literally represent *all*
distances in the input data set.

\   

We see that:

- Probabilities of infection for genotype DSF plants are in the 95% CI:
(`r round(infection_results["p_infect_dsf_full","cilower"], 2)`,
`r round(infection_results["p_infect_dsf_full","ciupper"], 2)`), with
median = `r round(infection_results["p_infect_dsf_full","median"], 2)`.
- Probabilities of infection for genotype WT plants are in the 95% CI:
(`r round(infection_results["p_infect_wt_full","cilower"], 2)`,
`r round(infection_results["p_infect_wt_full","ciupper"], 2)`), with
median = `r round(infection_results["p_infect_wt_full","median"], 2)`.

\  

This is not so surprising.  It says that for each genotype, when we consider **all** plant,
vector, and distance combinations, there's huge variation (nearly
spanning the interval [0, 1]) in the probability of test plant infection.

\   

These agree well with the predictions at distance = 0, although the
95% intervals here are wider, since this is representative of all possible
distances (giving larger variation in the probability of infection).
The medians are similar, although the median probability of test plant
infection is 15% for DSF source plants, and 35% for WT source plants.

\   

### Hierarchical Plots (updated v5)

\    

Predicted probability of infection versus observed xf concentration
in vectors (log base 10), separated by genotype.  We include best-fit
regression lines.

This plot has been updated since adding the new probabilistic models
for zero xf transmissions, in the source plant and the vectors.  The
plot below shows how the probability of infection varies as a function
of xf concentration in the vectors, for each plant genotype.

\

### Posterior Density Plots (updated v5)

\   
 
##### Predictive distributions for test plant infection (significantly updated v5) 

\   

Below are the posterior predictive distributions for test plant 
infection, for genotype DSF and WT plants, predicted at distance = 0. 

\   

```{r fig.height=2}
samplesPlot(samples[[1]], c('p_infect_dsf','p_infect_wt'), width = 4, height = 2, traceplot = FALSE)
```

\   

Below are the posterior predictive distributions for test plant 
infection, for genotype DSF and WT plants, for all distances.

These have changed greatly, since the addition of allowing
zero-transmissions of xf bacteria from source plants, and also to
vectors.  These zero-transmission cases give rise to the bimodal
distributions seen below, for probability of infection.  The large
modes near probability of infection = 0 represent those cases where
there was zero transmission of bacteria either at the source plant, or
to the vector, and hence the probability of infection is also zero.

The much larger mass near to probability of infection = 0 for the
DSF genotype is explained by the results we've seen above.  For DSF
plants there was only a 47% chance of any bacteria being present at
the source plant test site (versus 65% chance for WT plants; much more
likely to have bacteria).  And more minor, but still pushing the results
in the same direction, the probability of bacteria transmission to the
vectors was 50% for DSF source plants (versus a higher 56% for WT
plants).  Both of these results (from the new probabilistic
transmission models) drive the results below, where there's a large
mode around probability of infection = 0 for DSF plants, and a similar
but much smaller mode for WT source plants.

```{r fig.height=2}
#### Plot posterior probabilities for P(transmission)
set.seed(0)
pinfect_df <- data.frame(p_infect_dsf = sample(pinfect_dsf,length(pinfect_wt)),
                         p_infect_wt  = pinfect_wt)
samplesPlot(pinfect_df, c('p_infect_wt', 'p_infect_dsf'), width = 12, height = 12, traceplot = FALSE, legend = FALSE,
              file = "results/posterior_density_ptransmission_plot.tiff")
```


\   
 
##### Posterior densities of transmission probabilities (new v5)

First, compare the posterior distributions of presense of xf bacteria 
at source plant test sites, for DSF and WT source plants.

We see a reasonable difference in these probabilities, namely that WT
source plants are more likely to have bacteria present at the test site.

```{r fig.height=2}
samplesPlot(samples[[1]], c('p_trans_plant_dsf', 'p_trans_plant_wt'), width = 4, height = 2, traceplot = FALSE) 
```

\   

Next, compare the posterior distributions of transfer of xf bacteria 
from the source plant to the vectors, for DSF and WT source plants.

We see essentially no difference here between DSF at WT source
plants.  If bacteria are present at the test site, then vectors are
equally likely to acquire the bacteria from either at DSF or a WT
source plant.

```{r fig.height=2}
samplesPlot(samples[[1]], c('p_trans_vector_dsf', 'p_trans_vector_wt'), width = 4, height = 2, traceplot = FALSE) 
```
